# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-21)

**Core value:** Frictionless fallback that just works when you hit the wall
**Current focus:** Phase 4 - Reports (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 5 (Reports)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (includes gap closure)
Status: Phase complete (with gap closure)
Last activity: 2026-01-22 - Completed 04-04-PLAN.md (Wire Orchestrator Return)

Progress: ████████████████████ 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 13
- Average duration: 10.0 min
- Total execution time: 2.13 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2 | 25 min | 12.5 min |
| 2 | 4 | 30 min | 7.5 min |
| 3 | 3 | 40 min | 13.3 min |
| 4 | 4 | 38 min | 9.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 14min (04-01), 12min (04-02), 7min (04-03), 5min (04-04)
- Phase 4 gap closure efficient

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from research recommendations, depth=quick
- [Roadmap]: OpenCode as sole v1 target platform (other platforms deferred to v2)
- [01-01]: ESM (type: module) for native Node.js module support
- [01-01]: tsup for build (simpler than tsc for CLI tooling)
- [01-01]: picocolors instead of chalk (ESM compatibility)
- [01-01]: Vitest for testing (faster than Jest)
- [01-01]: process.exitCode instead of process.exit() (proper CLI exit handling)
- [01-02]: initialValue: false for confirm() - requires explicit user acceptance (clickwrap pattern)
- [01-02]: isCancel() handling for Ctrl+C graceful exit
- [01-02]: Manifesto shows even in quiet mode (consent is mandatory)
- [02-01]: Three-phase detection: existence -> validation -> freshness
- [02-01]: 90-day threshold for freshness warnings
- [02-01]: Git-first freshness with file mtime fallback
- [02-01]: spawnSync with 5s timeout for git commands
- [02-01]: existsSync acceptable for quick .git metadata check
- [02-02]: Filesystem PATH detection (no shell spawn for where/which)
- [02-02]: PATHEXT env var on Windows with fallback defaults
- [02-02]: Return null for not found (no exceptions)
- [02-03]: Promise.all for parallel GSD+OpenCode detection
- [02-03]: isCancel() handling in detection prompts
- [02-03]: ValidationReport as aggregate type for detection results
- [02-03]: Visual checkmarks for detection status display
- [02-03]: --detect CLI flag for detection-only mode
- [02-04]: spawnSync with 30s timeout for git pull (update operations need longer than 5s detection timeout)
- [02-04]: Manual update instructions on git pull failure
- [02-04]: Vitest mocking pattern with vi.mock() for interactive CLI testing
- [03-01]: Regex-based XML parsing (avoids xml2js dependency)
- [03-01]: SHA256 content hashing sorted by filename for deterministic idempotency
- [03-01]: Best-effort parsing (continue on errors, track in GSDGaps)
- [03-02]: JSON import with type: json for ESM compatibility
- [03-02]: Deep merge for user override rules (user takes precedence)
- [03-02]: Separate files per OpenCode convention (agents.json, etc.)
- [03-02]: Sorted keys for deterministic output (idempotency)
- [03-03]: Backups stored relative to OpenCode config dir (.opencode-backup/)
- [03-03]: SHA256 for all file integrity verification
- [03-03]: Project-local .opencode/ preferred if no existing config found
- [03-03]: Root tag detection for XML type (not just presence of tag)
- [03-03]: Auto-backup with announcement, no confirmation prompts (per context decision)
- [04-01]: Object-based unmappedFields array (breaking change from string[])
- [04-01]: Three gap categories: unsupported (red), platform (yellow), missing-dependency (blue)
- [04-01]: Categories and suggestions stored in transform-rules.json for user customization
- [04-02]: TransformedArtifactsMetadata as separate interface for clarity
- [04-02]: Simplified artifact status (all success/partial/failed based on global gaps)
- [04-02]: Unicode symbols for status (checkmark, warning, x-mark)
- [04-02]: dim styling for suggestions and source file paths
- [04-02]: markdown field placeholder for Plan 03 integration
- [04-03]: Template literals for markdown generation (no external library)
- [04-03]: YAML frontmatter with date, tool, version
- [04-03]: Collapsed <details> blocks for config JSON
- [04-03]: initialValue: true for markdown prompt (user likely wants detailed report)
- [04-03]: Hardcoded transpilation-report.md filename
- [04-04]: Array mapping for artifact name extraction (OpenCodeConfig uses arrays)
