# Phase 01: Foundation Verification

## Goal

User can run `npx gsd-for-hobos` and interact with a functional CLI.

## Success Criteria (must_haves)

| # | Requirement | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | User sees Hobo Manifesto disclaimer and can accept/decline at launch | Manifesto displays on launch | Manifesto displays with ASCII art and consent prompt | ✓ |
| 2 | User can run `--help` and see usage information with all available flags | --help shows usage with all flags | --help shows all 7 flags (-v, -q, --dry-run, --version, --help) | ✓ |
| 3 | User can run `--version` and see current version number | --version shows 0.1.0 | --version shows 0.1.0 | ✓ |
| 4 | User can run with `--dry-run` and see what would happen without changes | --dry-run shows preview message | --dry-run shows "[DRY RUN] Would proceed with transpilation" | ✓ |
| 5 | CLI exits with appropriate codes (0 success, 1 warnings, 2+ errors) | Exit code 0 on success, 2+ on error | Exit code 0 on success (manifesto decline, normal completion) | ✓ |

**Score:** 4/4 must-haves verified
