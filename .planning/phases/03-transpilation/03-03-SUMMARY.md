# Plan 03-03 Summary: Backup Manager, Idempotency, and CLI Integration

**Status:** Complete
**Duration:** ~15 min
**Commits:** 2fbed62, 250f901, 0395c2e, 0e86e77

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Name | Status | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Create backup manager | ✓ | src/lib/transpilation/backup-manager.ts |
| 2 | Create idempotency checker and orchestrator | ✓ | src/lib/transpilation/idempotency.ts, orchestrator.ts, types/index.ts |
| 3 | Create CLI command and integrate | ✓ | src/commands/transpile.ts, src/cli.ts |

## Implementation Summary

**BackupManager (backup-manager.ts):**
- Timestamped backups in `.opencode-backup/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS/`
- Manifest.json with file hashes, sizes, and permissions
- Restore with hash verification before overwrite
- cleanupWrittenFiles for partial write rollback
- listBackups and getLatestBackup utilities

**Idempotency (idempotency.ts):**
- hashDirectory: SHA256 of all files sorted by path
- checkIdempotency: Compare source hash with manifest
- writeManifest: Save transpilation metadata
- GFHManifest tracks source/output hashes and mappings

**Orchestrator (orchestrator.ts):**
- Full pipeline: parse → transform → emit → write
- Auto-detect OpenCode config directory
- Backup before write (unless --no-backup)
- Atomic writes with rollback on failure
- Dry-run validates without writing
- Gap reporting for unmapped/approximated features

**CLI Command (transpile.ts, cli.ts):**
- `gfh transpile` subcommand
- Flags: --force, --no-backup
- Global flags: --dry-run, -v, -q
- Exit codes: SUCCESS, WARNING, ERROR
- Reports backup location and manifest path

**Types Added:**
- BackupManifest, BackupFileEntry
- GFHManifest
- TranspileOptions, TranspileResult

**Bug Fix:**
- Fixed XML root tag detection (parser.ts) - commands with `<agent>` child tags were being parsed as agents

## Verification

All success criteria met:
- ✓ Transpilation backs up existing configs (auto-backup, no prompts)
- ✓ Transpilation is atomic (all files written or none)
- ✓ Rollback restores from backup on any error
- ✓ Running transpilation twice produces identical results (idempotent)
- ✓ CLI command is integrated and functional

## Decisions Made

- [03-03]: Backups stored relative to OpenCode config dir (.opencode-backup/)
- [03-03]: SHA256 for all file integrity verification
- [03-03]: Project-local .opencode/ preferred if no existing config found
- [03-03]: Root tag detection for XML type (not just presence of tag)
