# GSD for Hobos (gfh)

> "A context-migration utility for the computationally impoverished."

**GSD for Hobos (GFH)** is a trans-platform context transporter. It takes the
high-end context engineering of
[Get Shit Done (GSD)](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) and
transpiles it for "economy-class" AI platforms.

When your Claude Code token usage looks like a phone number and you’re staring
down a rate-limit lockout, `gfh` ensures your fallback tools (OpenCode, Cursor,
etc.) have been briefed on your mission.

## Are you lost?

If you're not in the hobo class, and you landed here by mistake, go and visit
[GSD on bags.fm](https://bags.fm/$glittercowboy) and help Lex do GSD fulltime so
we can all benefit.

## The Workflow

1. **Consent:** You agree to the "Hobo Manifesto" (Disclaimer).
2. **Freshness Check:** The script runs the official GSD update to ensure you
   aren't migrating stale logic.
3. **Detection:** It scans your system for supported "Hobo-tier" platforms.
4. **Transpilation:** It reads your GSD files from your Claude profile and
   adapts them (slash commands, system prompts, and rules) to your other tools.
5. **The Hobo Report:** A summary of what successfully migrated and what
   features were too "high-society" for your fallback tools to handle.

## Supported Targets

| Rank | Platform        | Status      | Notes                                                |
| ---- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **OpenCode**    | Baseline    | The gold standard for low-overhead productivity.     |
| 2    | **Antigravity** | Target      | High capability, low cost.                           |
| 3    | **Cursor**      | Target      | For the hobo who found a $20 bill on the sidewalk.   |
| 4    | **Windsurf**    | Target      | Flow-state friendly.                                 |
| 5    | **ChatLLM**     | Target      | The ultimate fallback.                               |
| ?    | **VS Code**     | Researching | Can it handle slash commands? We're looking into it. |
